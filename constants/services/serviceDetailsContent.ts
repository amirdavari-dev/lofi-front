            "Yes, but only if you target the right audience with the right message. Broad campaigns waste budget fast.

              It depends on the target audience and property type:<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢        Google Ads = High-intent buyers searching for properties now.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢        Meta Ads = Great for retargeting, building brand presence, and capturing interest.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢        TikTok = Effective for viral property tours and branding (especially for younger or overseas buyers).<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢        LinkedIn = Works well for investor-driven campaigns and B2B partnerships.

          question:
            "Why do I get leads from paid ads, but most of them don‚Äôt answer or convert?",
          answer: `
            This often means there‚Äôs a mismatch between targeting, messaging, and lead handling. Some common issues:<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢        Ads are too broad (attracting unqualified leads).<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢        Landing pages lack credibility or clarity.<br />

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢        Event tracking (e.g. calls, form fills, WhatsApp clicks).<br />

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Ä¢        CRM integration to trace lead quality.<br />
            Without these, you‚Äôre flying blind ‚Äî and likely wasting ad spend.

          question: "Why does HushLeads require an 8-month contract?",
          answer:
            "Real estate SEO and paid ads take time to build momentum. The first months are about fixing foundations, launching campaigns, collecting data, and optimizing. By month 3, we start seeing clear results ‚Äî and by months 4‚Äì8, we‚Äôre scaling. The 8-month model ensures we deliver compounding growth, not just spikes.",

          answer:
            "Not necessarily. If your current website is well-built, we‚Äôll optimize it. But if it‚Äôs outdated, slow, or unstructured, we‚Äôll build custom SEO-first landing pages designed to convert traffic into qualified leads.",
